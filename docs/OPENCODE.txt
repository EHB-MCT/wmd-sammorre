PLAN: can you read links from the web like this one: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ . If so can you tell me whats it about

PLAN: i plan to use vue.js and an data visualiser npm to show that data, how can i make it so that if i run the docker compose file that the webpage with the data opens

BUILD: can you read the OPENCODE.txt file and execute the commands (opencode: Make a new feature branch based these conventions: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
after that install vue and the d3.js npm
after that update the docker compose so that the webpage opens when i start the compose file
only commit if i ask based on the git conventions of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

BUILD: can you first make a commit based on the git conventions of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/ 

BUILD: can you make a graph with the users  as x and the total sessions as y and rank it from highest to lowest show max 10 users (if there is less than 10 users show case all of them)

BUILD: can you make a commit of what we have based on the git conventions of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

PLAN: can your read OPENCODE.txt and tell me what it is about
(opencode: step 1 Make a new feature branch based features using these conventions: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/
step 2 expanded the webpage (do not remove parts of it). I need to make more charts that show the userdata, graph 1 is zoomable icicle about the user productgenre,
with a structure of product genre and then the specific product then total view time, the icicle colors should be based on the product genre (make it so that i can easily input which colors to assign to a genre in case i wanna change a color later), when clicking an a genre it should show the specific product in those genre that the user looked at and when clicking on a product it should show the time, make it full width with adjustable height, make the time also in Minutes and seconds (e.g., "2 min 5 sec")
graph 2 should be about when the session happend (show only the date, hour and minutes), make the chart horizontal and have it bars based on duration
i can change the chart data by inputing a inputfield with a username (both chart change when a user is filled), make the base user (when the page loads in) the the user with the most sessions.
when inputing the user, show a dropdown with all the users that include those letters, if a user doesnt exist give an error in the input field,
do not use pie charts
make the charts under eachother 
only commit if i ask based on the git conventions of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

based on the git conventions of https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) using gitflow as branch structure


// opencode can make propmt summaries

Git Operations:
- Clear the database
- Replace bar chart with zoomable icicle visualization
- Fix user session counting by correcting SQL GROUP BY clause
- Add consistent color coding for products within same category
- Show all users when search field is empty

Unity Script:
- Analyze product detection issues (duplicate names, hierarchy problems)
- Understand current Unity hierarchy expectations (Products → Category → Product)
- Implement tag-based detection solution
- Fix IndexOutOfRangeException in CSV data generation

Technical Solutions Provided:
- Tag-based hierarchy detection using Unity tags
- Support for Products → Category (Product tag) → Product Items structure  
- Multiple products with same names support
- Proper error handling and fallbacks

API Improvements:
- Fixed SQL GROUP BY issues
- Added /users endpoint for fetching all users
- Corrected duplicate user entries

Frontend Enhancements:
- Real-time session filtering
- Responsive design improvements
- Zoomable D3 icicle chart implementation
- Color consistency across product categories
- Enhanced user interface elements

API Changes (ObjectLookTimeAPI.cs):
- Modified /looktime endpoint to process 4-level hierarchy 
- Extract product parent name for display instead of full hierarchy
- Enhanced debugging and error handling

Web Frontend Changes (SessionVisualization.vue):
- Added clean name function to remove numbers from product names
- Fixed chart proportional sizing issues 
- Implemented zoomable icicle chart with proper transitions
- Added professional chart features (zoom, back button, tooltips)

System Operations:
- Multiple Docker rebuilds to ensure clean deployment
- Database schema analysis and verification
- Frontend debugging and browser compatibility checks
