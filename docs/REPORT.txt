# Project Outcome Summary

## Purpose & Vision

The purpose of this project was supposed to be a game simulation where player uses AR glasses to help out with his shopping while on backend system takes notes on what the player looks at and for how long.

## Current Reality

Unfortunately, the project couldn't finish on time. The current state of the project is: products where the player looks at get stored in a database where you can see a visualization on a webpage.

## Shortcomings & Challenges

### Data Quality Issues
The shortcomings of the data is that we don't really know the reason why a person needs a product. Is he looking at it because there is a sale going on, or is it something else? This means that we need to guess what the data tells us.

### Proposed Solution
To improve this, we could record each session so that we have a visual image of what the person sees, along with environmental context like sale signs, product placements, and user interactions.

## Lessons Learned

### Open Source Project Management
What I learned from this project is how to make a project open source: I learned about licensing, standards, contributions, code of conduct, and the importance of proper documentation.

### Technical Skills Development
I also learned how to and why to use Docker as a program for containerization and deployment.

### Project Structure & Dependencies
An issue that came up is that I relied too much on open code and didn't really think about project structure. I also struggled with commits - I didn't really commit in early stages of the project, and when I did, I wasn't really following git branch rules.

### Time Management & Planning
The thing that messed me up the most was underestimating the project scale which led me to a time shortage where I couldn't finish the project the way I envisioned it.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Better Planning Needed**: Accurate time estimation and scope definition are crucial
2. **Project Structure**: Investing time in proper project architecture pays dividends
3. **Version Control**: Regular commits and proper branch management are essential
4. **Dependency Management**: Balance between using external code and building custom solutions
5. **Documentation**: Open source practices and documentation should be integrated from the start

## Future Improvements

If this project were to be continued, I would focus on:
- Better time management and realistic scope setting
- Improved project structure from day one
- More robust data collection with context
- Regular commit habits following conventional commits
- Proper gitflow implementation from the beginning
